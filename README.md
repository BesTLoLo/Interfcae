# Interfcae

Typescript with interfaces

1- Run `npm install`
2- Run npm tsc ## to run the combiler, also no need to run the command every time you change the code. I set it to watch the changes and it will combine it.
3- Run npm start to start the server ## no need to stop the server and run it again, nodemon will do that for you every time you save any file in the application
